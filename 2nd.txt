Aim: Design Christmas dual led chaser lights.
Apparatus: Arduino, LEDâ€™s, Resistance 470 ohm, wires, Breadboard
Procedure:
step1:
take a arduino and a breadboard.
step2:
take 4 led's with 4 resistors.
step3:
join them in a circuit 
step 4 :
providing power supply with computer
step5:
now it starts blinking with a pattern 
step5:
pattern is first glow with 2 first leds then glow in same pattern.
Result
Chasing of LED was verified after uploading the program.
